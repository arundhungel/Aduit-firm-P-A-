                                    <p>Auditing is highly complex process, and the importance of auditors as a vital link in the financial reporting chain and their role as trusted advisors has increased manifold in the present era. The audit may be required by statute; and if properly planned, it can become a useful management tool. Our approach enables us to focus our time and effort on the most significant areas of the accounts and controls. So we not only keep our time cost to a minimum but also increase the effectiveness of the audit and thus provide maximum value to the client.</p>

                                    <p>The process of obtaining comprehensive understanding of the client’s business, accounting system and internal controls enable us to focus on key areas besides doing the normal audit. This process also depends upon client-to-client requirements. This approach ensures that the professional and commercial experience of the members of the firm is constantly brought to bear on a client’s affairs.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        The thrust is to audit for the statutory requirements and also simultaneously report the irregularities and the weakness in the internal control and systems for proper action and rectification.
